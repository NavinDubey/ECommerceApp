# ðŸ›’ ECommerce App

An Android application built using **Kotlin** and following the **MVVM** architecture. This app
fetches product data from the **FakeStore API** and allows users to add items to a cart, manage
quantities, and view an order summary. The app uses **Room Database** for data persistence, *
*Retrofit** for network operations, and **Hilt** (with **Dagger**) for dependency injection.

## ðŸš€ Features

1. **Product List**  
   Fetches a list of products from the FakeStore API and displays them using a `RecyclerView`. Each
   item shows:
    - Product Name
    - Product Image
    - Price
    - Add to Cart button

2. **Cart Management**  
   Users can:
    - Add products to the cart
    - View and update the cart
    - Increase/decrease item quantities
    - Remove items  
      Cart data is stored locally using Room Database to persist changes.

3. **Order Summary**  
   Displays the total number of items and the total price of the cart.
